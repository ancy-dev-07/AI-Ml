What is NumPy?

NumPy = Numerical Python
It is used for:

Working with numbers

Handling large data fast

Arrays (better than Python lists)

Used in ML, AI, Data Science


import NumPy as np
Python List vs NumPy Array

python List → slow for math

NumPy array → very fast for math


Why do we use Zero Array (np.zeros)?
📌 Purpose

To create an empty container filled with zeros.

🔹 Why needed?

To initialize memory

To store results later

To avoid random garbage values

✅ Example:

Suppose you want to store marks of 5 students, but you don’t know them yet.


import numpy as np

marks = np.zeros(5)
print(marks)


marks[0] = 85
marks[1] = 90


Used in:

Machine learning (weights initialization)

Image processing (black image)

Counters & accumulators


Why do we use Ones Array (np.ones)?
📌 Purpose

To create an array already filled with 1.

🔹 Why needed?

To multiply values

To initialize bias values

To create a base array

✅ Example:

Suppose each product costs ₹100, and you have 5 products.


price = np.ones(5) * 100
print(price)


Used in:

ML bias initialization

Scaling values

Creating test data


Why do we use Range Array (np.arange)?
📌 Purpose

To create sequence of numbers automatically.

🔹 Why needed?

Avoid manual typing

Create indexes

Generate time steps

✅ Example:

Create roll numbers from 1 to 10:



Used in:

Indexing

Loop replacement

Data simulation


| Function   | What it Creates | Why it’s Used       |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| `zeros()`  | All 0 values    | Empty storage       |
| `ones()`   | All 1 values    | Base / multiplier   |
| `arange()` | Sequence        | Automatic numbering |


| What          | Code        |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| First row     | `arr[0]`    |
| First element | `arr[0][0]` |
| 50            | `arr[1][1]` |
| 90            | `arr[2][2]` |



NumPy Functions:

sum()

mean()

max(), min()

axis concept


NumPy – Lesson 7: Built-in Functions & axis
1️⃣ Why NumPy Functions?

They help us analyze data quickly without loops.

Understanding axis (Very Important Concept)

What does axis mean?

| axis     | Meaning     |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `axis=0` | column-wise |
| `axis=1` | row-wise    |

Why This Matters

Used in statistics

Used in ML feature calculations

Used in data preprocessing
