## what is Data structure

A Data Structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

Simple meaning:

Data Structure = How data is stored and arranged

Example:

- Storing marks in a list

- Storing student details using dictionary

- Storing items in a queue (like a line)

🔹 Real-life example:

Books in a library
- If books are arranged properly (by subject, author), we can find them fast.

- If books are scattered randomly, searching is slow.

## Why is it called “Data Structure”?

- Data → Information

- Structure → Arrangement / Organization

It is called Data Structure because it focuses on:

How data is structured (organized) in memory

## Types of Data Structures

- Primitive – int, float, char, boolean

- Non-Primitive

- Linear – Array, List, Stack, Queue

- Non-Linear – Tree, Graph


## What is an Algorithm?
Definition:

An Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.

- Simple meaning:

Algorithm = How to solve a problem step by step


##### Example (Real life):

- Making tea

- Boil water

- Add tea powder

- Add sugar

- Add milk

- Serve

 This is an algorithm.

#### Why the name?

Named after Al-Khwarizmi, a mathematician

#### Example:
Steps to find largest number in a list.


| Data Structure          | Algorithm                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Stores data             | Processes data              |
| Focuses on organization | Focuses on logic            |
| Example: Array          | Example: Searching, Sorting |


### Why Study DSA?

Faster programs

Less memory usage

Coding interviews

Real-world applications (Google, apps, GPS)


### Example:

- Array (Data Structure)

- Binary Search (Algorithm)

#### Simple Example Combining Both
```
# Data Structure: List
numbers = [10, 5, 20, 8]

# Algorithm: Find maximum number
max_num = numbers[0]

for num in numbers:
    if num > max_num:
        max_num = num

print(max_num)



```
